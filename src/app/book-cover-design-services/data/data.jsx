There are a few things that make a good book cover design. First, it does have an easy-to-read title and easy-to-recognize author information prominently displayed. In addition, the book cover should accurately reflect the genre of the book, i.e., a comic book cover creator will design a different cover for comic books than romance novels. Last but not least, it is also important to remember that the book cover is an important marketing tool. Therefore, the cover should accurately reflect the book's content. More so, a good cover design can also help set the book's tone and give readers an idea of what to expect from the story."
